     but essentially it means that we want you to let others know how much you love Firefox. -->

     get people to rate us by playfully telling them there's a benefit in it for them as well. -->

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (sad.thanksMessageBottom): We're suggesting that there will be consequences for the people working
     on Firefox if they don't resolve the user's problem, like "or if they don't fix it, we'll fire them." If this doesn't
     work in your language, you can change it to something like "no matter what" or just remove it entirely. -->
